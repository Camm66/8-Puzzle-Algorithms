# 8-Puzzle Algorithms
This project is an implementation of the 8-puzzle search problem. The following algorithms are explored: Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Uniform-Cost, Best-First, and A* (with three separate heuristic functions).

## Instructions to run this program:
First, navigate to the root directory containing the following files:
* EightPuzzle_Tests.py
* EightPuzzle.py

Then, run the following command:

```
python EightPuzzle_Tests.py
```
